<h2>Trending Cars For Rent At Available Prices</h2>
<p>Luxury cars are available for car rental in several cities around India. People travelling across states may have to submit the RT-PCR test report. Tourists should refer to the guidelines for specific locations and adhere to them while travelling. 

    For travel via car within the state, double vaccine shots might be necessary. The protocols change from state to state, and it is important to check them before renting a car. 
    
    A temperature check is conducted for all passengers and the driver before the start of the journey.</p>

  <h1>Our Packages For Rent</h1>
  <h2>Details</h2>
  <p>With many rental companies, you must be at least 21 years of age to rent a car, and any driver under 25 may have to pay a Young Driver Fee. Similarly, people aged 70+ may find some companies will charge a Senior Driver Fee, or may not rent to them at all.
    So car rental for the under-25s or over-70s can be more expensive – which is one more reason to book with Rentalcars.com, as we work with all the big brands. Just check each car’s terms and conditions to see if your age would make any difference.</p>
